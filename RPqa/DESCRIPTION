Description: This package provides tools to create and quantitavely analyse recurrence plots (RP),
 cross-recurrene plots (CRP) and joint rcurrence plots (JRP) applying standard nonlinear techniques
 for time series. The package allows to embedded the time series, and specify relevant parameter for
 a complete analysis of recurrence in the new state space, along with bootstrap evaluation of some
 of the quantitative indices.
